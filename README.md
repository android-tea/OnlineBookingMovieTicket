# Online Movie Booking System

## Description

This is my first attempt at creating a simple website using HTML and CSS. It provides a basic movie booking experience. The homepage features a clean layout with a list of movies, along with their details like posters, titles, and short descriptions. Each movie has a button that allows users to select a schedule and book tickets. The design is simple, focusing on the essential features while learning the basics of web development.

## Features

- User-friendly homepage with movie listings.
- Movie details including posters, titles, and synopses.
- Schedule selection for booking tickets.
- Simple and responsive design.
