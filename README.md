# Online Movie Booking System

## Description

This is my first attempt at creating a simple website using HTML and CSS. It provides a basic movie booking experience. The homepage features a layout with a list of movies, along with their details like posters, titles, and short descriptions. Each movie has a button that allows users to select a schedule and book tickets. The design is simple, focusing on the essential features while learning the basics of web development.

**Check the updated code** â€“ this is my first attempt, so it might be a bit messy!
